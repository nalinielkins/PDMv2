 IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics Version 2 (PDMv2) Destination
                                 Option
                draft-elkins-ippm-encrypted-pdmv2-latest

Abstract

   RFC8250 describes an optional Destination Option (DO) header embedded
   in each packet to provide sequence numbers and timing information as
   a basis for measurements.  As this data is sent in clear- text, this
   may create an opportunity for malicious actors to get information for
   subsequent attacks.  This document defines PDMv2 which has a
   lightweight handshake (registration procedure) and encryption to
   secure this data.  Additional performance metrics which may be of use
   are also defined.
