--- abstract

RFC8250 describes an optional Destination Option (DO) header embedded
in each packet to provide sequence numbers and timing information as
a basis for measurements.  As this data is sent in clear- text, this
may create an opportunity for malicious actors to get information for
subsequent attacks.  This document defines PDMv2 which has a
lightweight handshake (registration procedure) and encryption to
secure this data.  Additional performance metrics which may be of use
are also defined.

# Introduction

## Current Performance and Diagnostic Metrics (PDM)

The current PDM is an IPv6 Destination Options header which provides
information based on the metrics like Round-trip delay and Server
delay.  This information helps to measure the Quality of Service
(QoS) and to assist in diagnostics.  However, there are potential
risks involved transmitting PDM data during a diagnostics session.

PDM metrics can help an attacker understand about the type of machine
and its processing capabilities.  Inferring from the PDM data, the
attack can launch a timing attack.  For example, if a cryptographic
protocol is used, a timing attack may be launched against the keying
material to obtain the secret.

Along with this, PDM does not provide integrity.  It is possible for
a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) node to modify PDM headers leading to
incorrect conclusions.  For example, during the debugging process
using PDM header, it can mislead the person showing there are no
unusual server delays.


## PDMv2 Introduction

PDMv2 adds confidentiality, integrity and authentication to PDM.

PDMv2 consists of three kinds of flows:

- Primary to Primary

- Primary to Secondary

- Secondary to Secondary

These terms are defined in Section 3.  Sample topologies may be found
in Appendix 1.

This document describes the Secondary to Secondary protocol and
security requirements.  The Primary to Primary and Primary to
Secondary protocol will be described in a subsequent document.


# Conventions used in this document

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Terminology

-  Primary Client (PC): An authoritative node that creates
   cryptographic keys for multiple Secondary clients.

-  Primary Server (PS): An authoritative node that creates
   cryptographic keys for multiple Secondary servers.

-  Secondary Client (SC): An endpoint node which initiates a session
   with a listening port and sends PDM data.  Connects to the Primary
   Client to get cryptographic key material.

-  Secondary Server (SS): An endpoint node which has a listening port
   and sends PDM data.  Connects to the Primary Server to get
   cryptographic key material.

Note: a client may act as a server (have listening ports).

-  Symmetric Key (K): A uniformly random bitstring as an input to the
   encryption algorithm, known only to Secondary Clients and
   Secondary Servers, to establish a secure communication.

-  Public and Private Keys: A pair of keys that is used in asymmetric
   cryptography.  If one is used for encryption, the other is used
   for decryption.  Private Keys are kept hidden by the source of the
   key pair generator, but Public Key is known to everyone.  pkX
   (Public Key) and skX (Private Key).  Where X can be, any client or
   any server.

-  Pre-shared Key (PSK): A symmetric key.  Uniformly random
   bitstring, shared between any client or any server or a key shared
   between an entity that forms client-server relationship.  This
   could happen through an out-of band mechanism: e.g., a physical
   meeting or use of another protocol.

-  Session Key: A temporary key which acts as a symmetric key for the
   whole session.

# Protocol Flow

The protocol will proceed in 3 steps.

{:req1: counter="bar" style="format Step %d:"}

{: req1}
- Negotiation between Primary Server and Primary Client.
- Registration between Primary Server / Client and Secondary
  Server / Client
- PDM data flow between Secondary Client and Secondary Server

After-the-fact (or real-time) data analysis of PDM flow may occur by
network diagnosticians or network devices.  The definition of how
this is done is out of scope for this document.

## Registration Phase

### Rationale of Primary and Secondary Roles

Enterprises have many servers and many clients.  These clients and
servers may be in multiple locations.  It may be less overhead to
have a secure location (ex.  Shared database) for servers and clients
to share keys.  Otherwise, each client needs to keep track of the
keys for each server.

Please view Appendix 1 for some sample topologies and further
explanation.

## Primary Client - Primary Server Negotiation Phase

The two entities exchange a set of data to ensure the respective
identities.

They use HPKE KEM to negotiate a "SharedSecret".

## Primary Server / Client - Secondary Server / Client Registration Phase

The "SharedSecret" is shared securely:

-  By the Primary Client to all the Secondary Clients under its
   control.  The protocol to define this will be defined in a
   subsequent document.

-  By the Primary Server to all the Secondary Servers under its
   control.  The protocol to define this will be defined in a
   subsequent document.

## Secondary Client - Secondary Server communication

Each Client and Server derive a "SessionTemporaryKey" by using HPKE
KDF, using the following inputs:

-  The "SharedSecret".

-  The 5-tuple (SrcIP, SrcPort, DstIP, DstPort, Protocol) of the
   communication.

-  A Key Rotation Index (Kri).

The Kri SHOULD be initialized to zero.

The server and client initialize (separately) a pseudo-random non-
repeating sequence between 1 and 2^15-1.  How to generate this
sequence is beyond the scope of this document, and does not affect
the rest of the specification.  When the sequence is used fully, or
earlier if appropriate, the sender signals the other party that a key
change is necessary.  This is achieved by flipping the "F bit" and
resetting the PRSEQ.  The receiver increments the Kri of the sender,
and derives another SessionTemporaryKey to be used for decryption.

It shall be stressed that the two SessionTemporaryKeys used in the
communication are never the same, as the 5-tuple is reversed for the
Server and Client.  Moreover, the time evolution of the respective
Kri can be different.  As a consequence, each entity must maintain a
table with (at least) the following informations:

-  Flow 5-tuple, Own Kri, Other Kri

An implementation might optimize this further by caching the
OwnSessionTemporaryKey (used in Encryption) and
OtherSessionTemporaryKey (used in Decryption).

# Security Goals

As discussed in the introduction, PDM data can represent a serious
data leakage in presence of a malicious actor.

In particular, the sequence numbers included in the PDM header allows
correlating the traffic flows, and the timing data can highlight the
operational limits of a server to a malicious actor.  Moreover,
forging PDM headers can lead to unnecessary, unwanted, or dangerous
operational choices, e.g., to restore an apparently degraded Quality
of Service (QoS).

Due to this, it is important that the confidentiality and integrity
of the PDM headers is maintained.  PDM headers can be encrypted and
authenticated using the methods discussed in Section 5.4, thus
ensuring confidentiality and integrity.  However, if PDM is used in a
scenario where the integrity and confidentiality is already ensured
by other means, they can be transmitted without encryption or
authentication.  This includes, but is not limited to, the following
cases:

{:req2: counter="bar" style="format %c:"}

{: req2}
- PDM is used over an already encrypted medium (For example VPN
  tunnels).
- PDM is used in a link-local scenario.
- PDM is used in a corporate network where there are security
  measures strong enough to consider the presence of a malicious
  actor a negligible risk.

## Security Goals for Confidentiality

PDM data must be kept confidential between the intended parties,
which includes (but is not limited to) the two entities exchanging
PDM data, and any legitimate party with the proper rights to access
such data.

## Security Goals for Integrity

PDM data must not be forged or modified by a malicious entity.  In
other terms, a malicious entity must not be able to generate a valid
PDM header impersonating an endpoint, and must not be able to modify
a valid PDM header.

## Security Goals for Authentication

An unauthorized party must not be able to send PDM data and must not
be able to authorize another entity to do so.  The protocol to define
this will be defined in a subsequent document.  Alternatively, if
authentication is done via any of the following, this requirement may
be seen to be met.

{:req3: counter="bar" style="format %c:"}

{: req3}
- PDM is used over an already authenticated medium (For example,
  TLS session).
- PDM is used in a link-local scenario.
- PDM is used in a corporate network where security measures are
  strong enough to consider the presence of a malicious actor a
  negligible risk.

## Cryptographic Algorithm

Symmetric key cryptography has performance benefits over asymmetric
cryptography; asymmetric cryptography is better for key management.
Encryption schemes that unite both have been specified in [RFC1421],
and have been participating practically since the early days of
public-key cryptography.  The basic mechanism is to encrypt the
symmetric key with the public key by joining both yields.  Hybrid
public-key encryption schemes (HPKE) [RFC9180] used a different
approach that generates the symmetric key and its encapsulation with
the public key of the receiver.

Our choice is to use the HPKE framework that incorporates key
encapsulation mechanism (KEM), key derivation function (KDF) and
authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD).  These multiple
schemes are more robust and significantly efficient than the
traditional schemes and thus lead to our choice of this framework.

# PDMv2 Destination Options

## Destinations Option Header

The IPv6 Destination Options extension header [RFC8200] is used to
carry optional information that needs to be examined only by a
packet's destination node(s).  The Destination Options header is
identified by a Next Header value of 60 in the immediately preceding
header and is defined in RFC 8200 [RFC8200].  The IPv6 PDMv2
destination option is implemented as an IPv6 Option carried in the
Destination Options header.

## Metrics information in PDMv2

The IPv6 PDMv2 destination option contains the following base fields:

    SCALEDTLR: Scale for Delta Time Last Received
    SCALEDTLS: Scale for Delta Time Last Sent
    GLOBALPTR: Global Pointer
    PSNTP: Packet Sequence Number This Packet
    PSNLR: Packet Sequence Number Last Received
    DELTATLR: Delta Time Last Received
    DELTATLS: Delta Time Last Sent

PDMv2 adds a new metric to the existing PDM [RFC8250] called the
Global Pointer.  The existing PDM fields are identified with respect
to the identifying information called a "5-tuple".

The 5-tuple consists of:

    SADDR: IP address of the sender
    SPORT: Port for the sender
    DADDR: IP address of the destination
    DPORT: Port for the destination
    PROTC: Upper-layer protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)

Unlike PDM fields, Global Pointer (GLOBALPTR) field in PDMv2 is
defined for the SADDR type.  Following are the SADDR address types
considered:

{:req4: counter="bar" style="format %c:"}

{: req4}
- Link-Local
- Global Unicast

The Global Pointer is treated as a common entity over all the
5-tuples with the same SADDR type.  It is initialised to the value 1
and increments for every packet sent.  Global Pointer provides a
measure of the amount of IPv6 traffic sent by the PDMv2 node.

When the SADDR type is Link-Local, the PDMv2 node sends Global
Pointer defined for Link-Local addresses, and when the SADDR type is
Global Unicast, it sends the one defined for Global Unicast
addresses.

### PDMv2 Layout

PDMv2 has two different header formats corresponding to whether the
metric contents are encrypted or unencrypted.  The difference between
the two types of headers is determined from the Options Length value.

Following is the representation of the unencrypted PDMv2 header:
