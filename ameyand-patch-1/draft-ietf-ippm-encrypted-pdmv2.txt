 IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics Version 2 (PDMv2) Destination

                 draft-ietf-ippm-encrypted-pdmv2-latest

Abstract

   RFC8250 describes an optional Destination Option (DO) header embedded
   in each packet to provide sequence numbers and timing information as
   a basis for measurements.  As this data is sent in clear- text, this
   may create an opportunity for malicious actors to get information for
   subsequent attacks.  This document defines PDMv2 which has a
   lightweight handshake (registration procedure) and encryption to
   secure this data.  Additional performance metrics which may be of use
   are also defined.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Current Performance and Diagnostic Metrics (PDM)

   The current PDM is an IPv6 Destination Options header which provides
   information based on the metrics like Round-trip delay and Server
   delay.  This information helps to measure the Quality of Service
   (QoS) and to assist in diagnostics.  However, there are potential
   risks involved transmitting PDM data during a diagnostics session.

   PDM metrics can help an attacker understand about the type of machine
   and its processing capabilities.  Inferring from the PDM data, the
   attack can launch a timing attack.  For example, if a cryptographic
   protocol is used, a timing attack may be launched against the keying
   material to obtain the secret.

   Along with this, PDM does not provide integrity.  It is possible for
   a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) node to modify PDM headers leading to
   incorrect conclusions.  For example, during the debugging process
   using PDM header, it can mislead the person showing there are no
   unusual server delays.

1.2.  PDMv2 Introduction

   PDMv2 adds confidentiality, integrity and authentication to PDM.

   PDMv2 consists of three kinds of flows:

   *  Primary to Primary

   *  Primary to Secondary

   *  Secondary to Secondary

   These terms are defined in Section 3.  Sample topologies may be found
   in Appendix 1.

   This document describes the Secondary to Secondary protocol and
   security requirements.  The Primary to Primary and Primary to
   Secondary protocol will be described in a subsequent document.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   *  Primary Client (PC): An authoritative node that creates
      cryptographic keys for multiple Secondary clients.

   *  Primary Server (PS): An authoritative node that creates
      cryptographic keys for multiple Secondary servers.

   *  Secondary Client (SC): An endpoint node which initiates a session
      with a listening port and sends PDM data.  Connects to the Primary
      Client to get cryptographic key material.

   *  Secondary Server (SS): An endpoint node which has a listening port
      and sends PDM data.  Connects to the Primary Server to get
      cryptographic key material.

   Note: a client may act as a server (have listening ports).

   *  Symmetric Key (K): A uniformly random bitstring as an input to the
      encryption algorithm, known only to Secondary Clients and
      Secondary Servers, to establish a secure communication.

   *  Public and Private Keys: A pair of keys that is used in asymmetric
      cryptography.  If one is used for encryption, the other is used
      for decryption.  Private Keys are kept hidden by the source of the
      key pair generator, but Public Key is known to everyone.  pkX
      (Public Key) and skX (Private Key).  Where X can be, any client or
      any server.

   *  Pre-shared Key (PSK): A symmetric key.  Uniformly random
      bitstring, shared between any client or any server or a key shared
      between an entity that forms client-server relationship.  This
      could happen through an out-of band mechanism: e.g., a physical
      meeting or use of another protocol.

   *  Session Key: A temporary key which acts as a symmetric key for the
      whole session.

4.  Protocol Flow

   The protocol will proceed in 3 steps.

   R(1)  Negotiation between Primary Server and Primary Client.

   R(2)  Registration between Primary Server / Client and Secondary
         Server / Client

   R(3)  PDM data flow between Secondary Client and Secondary Server

   After-the-fact (or real-time) data analysis of PDM flow may occur by
   network diagnosticians or network devices.  The definition of how
   this is done is out of scope for this document.

4.1.  Registration Phase

4.1.1.  Rationale of Primary and Secondary Roles

   Enterprises have many servers and many clients.  These clients and
   servers may be in multiple locations.  It may be less overhead to
   have a secure location (ex.  Shared database) for servers and clients
   to share keys.  Otherwise, each client needs to keep track of the
   keys for each server.

   Please view Appendix 1 for some sample topologies and further
   explanation.

4.2.  Primary Client - Primary Server Negotiation Phase

   The two entities exchange a set of data to ensure the respective
   identities.

   They use HPKE KEM to negotiate a "SharedSecret".

4.3.  Primary Server / Client - Secondary Server / Client Registration
      Phase

   The "SharedSecret" is shared securely:

   *  By the Primary Client to all the Secondary Clients under its
      control.  The protocol to define this will be defined in a
      subsequent document.

   *  By the Primary Server to all the Secondary Servers under its
      control.  The protocol to define this will be defined in a
      subsequent document.

4.4.  Secondary Client - Secondary Server communication

   Each Client and Server derive a "SessionTemporaryKey" by using HPKE
   KDF, using the following inputs:

   *  The "SharedSecret".

   *  The 5-tuple (SrcIP, SrcPort, DstIP, DstPort, Protocol) of the
      communication.

   *  A Key Rotation Index (Kri).

   The Kri SHOULD be initialized to zero.

   The server and client initialize (separately) a pseudo-random non-
   repeating sequence between 1 and 2^15-1.  How to generate this
   sequence is beyond the scope of this document, and does not affect
   the rest of the specification.  When the sequence is used fully, or
   earlier if appropriate, the sender signals the other party that a key
   change is necessary.  This is achieved by flipping the "F bit" and
   resetting the PRSEQ.  The receiver increments the Kri of the sender,
   and derives another SessionTemporaryKey to be used for decryption.

   It shall be stressed that the two SessionTemporaryKeys used in the
   communication are never the same, as the 5-tuple is reversed for the
   Server and Client.  Moreover, the time evolution of the respective
   Kri can be different.  As a consequence, each entity must maintain a
   table with (at least) the following informations:

   *  Flow 5-tuple, Own Kri, Other Kri

   An implementation might optimize this further by caching the
   OwnSessionTemporaryKey (used in Encryption) and
   OtherSessionTemporaryKey (used in Decryption).
